    <p class="middle psize"><strong>This is actually my Bengal. Bengals are a very rare breed of cat which makes them very
        expensive. Our cat costed us around $1500 which is a lot comparing to a typical cat. What
        makes them special is their fur which makes them look like leopard, a wild animal from the jungle. This breed
        is very obediant and sometimes like water as shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs4FbjZZQgg">here</a>.
