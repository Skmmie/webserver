    <p class="middle psize"><strong>It's simple..Cats are awesome. They are so cute that all you want to do is squish
                their little faces and hug their them. They are soft and release can actually release stress when you pet
                them. If you are interested about how that works, you can find more information about that topic <a href="https://pets.thenest.com/can-stroking-cats-fur-relieve-stress-8220.html">here</a>.
                I love my cats and I would never trade them for anything else. My passion for cats will now bring me to
                show off a few of my favourite breeds.</strong>
